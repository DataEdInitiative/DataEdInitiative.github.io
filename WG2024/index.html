								<h3>What is the plan?</h3>

								<p>Toni Taipalus and Daphne Miedema are organising a working group at the ACM conference on Innovation and Technology in Computer Science Education (<a href="https://iticse.acm.org/2024/" target="_blank">ITiCSE</a>). The idea behind a working group is to work together on a research question of interest, with both an online-asynchronous part as well as an in person collaboration colocated with the conference (in July - Milan, Italy).</p>

								<p>This working group we are recruiting for now will focus on existing data systems curricula, and comparing them to industry expectations of new grads.  We are looking for Data Systems teachers and others with an interest in Data Systems Education, to join us in this endeavor. You can read more about the proposed methods and schedules <a href="https://iticse.acm.org/2024/working-groups/#wg4">here</a> and apply <a href="https://forms.gle/qPtEMsjpGZREQ57H6">here</a> before March 11.</p>

								<p>Working groups are a great way to grow your professional network, and the resulting reports are often well-cited. As such, they provide a great opportunity, especially for more junior researchers.
								Please reach out to us if you have any questions.</p>
