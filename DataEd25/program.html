								<h3>Bo English-Wiczling </h3>
								<b>In the age of AI, Developers Must be Unicorns and Oracle Database Can Be Your Secret Weapon.</b>

								<p>Employers look for new hires with experience and knowledge of the technical tools and principles used most around the world, as well as familiarity with new technologies that are constantly emerging. Many employers have started to look for developers that can do it all – the elusive “unicorn”. These developers need to know emerging technologies including AI, how to build front ends, how to set up the middle tier, and how to set up back ends including infrastructure, networking and databases. This is no simple feat for a new developer just entering the workforce. At Oracle, we’re preparing developers to be a jack of all trades by making it easy to set up, use and expand databases that can support all the workloads and data types demanded by AI and emerging trends. Learn about free resources available for educators, how universities and customers have implemented Oracle into their ecosystem, and how you can do this all with support from the engineering teams at Oracle Database.</p>

								<p><img src="images/bo.png" align="right" valign="middle" width="300" style="padding:15px"/><b>Bio: </b>Bo English-Wiczling is a Senior Director in the Oracle Database Product Management team leading Database Developer Relations and is transforming the way developers use Oracle Database products and services. She joined Oracle almost 8 years ago from Amazon and has more than 29 years of experience in Tech, led large-scale product development teams, created enterprise departments, programs and startups from scratch, and founded several employee advocacy groups.<br /><br />

								Bo enjoys solving impossible challenges, including the first mobile phone activation platform at Best Buy used by 29 different Telcos across NA and Europe; the first Anti-Money Laundering platform at Amazon for millions of 3rd party marketplace sellers; and the first Developer Relations org in Oracle that transformed the culture at Oracle for interacting with millions of developers worldwide.<br /><br />

								She started her career as a web developer, and authored multiple applications for companies looking for an online presence, such as Allianz and American Heart Association. She has a double major in Computer Science and Philosophy from the University of Minnesota. Bo is a passionate advocate for AI advancement, open source communities, under-represented affiliations, and serves as the Board Advisor for Oracle’s Asian Professional Leadership (OPAL) employee resource group. She is also a Certified Scrum Master and Certified Agile Coach.<br /><br />

								Bo currently lives in Seattle, WA with her husband and 2 Chihuahuas. In her spare time, she likes to collect hobbies and make things, wander the earth, race sports cars, and she is an enthusiastic foodie. She is also especially fond of peaty Scotches.
